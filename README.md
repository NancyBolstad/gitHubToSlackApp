## Getting started with serverless

![img](/resources/gettingstarted.png)

This getting started series is written by the Serverless Developer advocate team @AWSCloud. It has been designed for developers who know how to code but are new to serverless. Follow along with blog posts, code samples, and practical exercises to learn how to build serverless applications from your local Integrated development environment (IDE).


### How to use this Repo

This repository is split into folders. Each folder has a corresponding blog post on the AWS serverless Compute blog. Read the blogs posts and refer back to the code samples in this repository:
